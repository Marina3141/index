<h2>How long do cats live?</h2>
<p>Cats may not really have nine lives, but factors such as diet, healthcare and environment can have an impact on how
    long a cat can live. Neutered cats tend to live longer because neutering prevents reproductive diseases and neutered
    cats are less likely to roam.

    While dependent on many things, including luck, some domestic cats can live to up to 20 years old. During their life
    they will go through six key life stages which may help owners understand certain health/behavioural problems that
    could arise and things to keep an eye on.</p>

<h2>Nutrition</h2>
<p>Diet is the brick and mortar of health. This web page lays out some often-ignored principles of feline nutrition and
    explains why cats have a better chance at optimal health if they are fed canned food (or a balanced homemade diet)
    instead of dry kibble.

    Putting a little thought into what you feed your cat(s) can pay big dividends over their lifetime and very possibly
    help them avoid serious, painful, and costly illnesses. An increasing number of nutrition-savvy veterinarians,
    including board-certified veterinary internists, are now strongly recommending the feeding of canned food instead of
    dry kibble.

    The three key negative issues associated with dry food are:
    1) water content is too low
    2) carbohydrate load is too high
    3) type of protein â€“ too high in plant-based versus animal-based proteins
